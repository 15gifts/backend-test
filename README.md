#Backend developer test for 15gifts

##Task

Please create a small application that will convert numbers from 1 to 1,000,000 into words. 
It will need to include all punctuation and conjunctions.

The application will need to allow the user to input a range (start and end). 
If no range is provided, it should output the entire range above (1 to 1000000 in words). 
Please use the programming language you feel most comfortable in and avoid using a package that does this conversion for you.

###Example use case:

The user enters a start number of "1000" and an end number of "2222".
The application will then output that range in words. For example:

- One thousand
- One thousand and one
- One thousand and two
...
- Two thousand, two hundred and twenty two

You have 2 hours to complete this test. We aren't necessarily looking for a complete solution, marks are also awarded on approach and best practice. 

Once you have finished and either upload your solution to your github/gitlab account and share a link with us. Create a blank repository for thia, do not fork this repository. You must include all files necessary to run the application and include instructions for running the script in a readme.
